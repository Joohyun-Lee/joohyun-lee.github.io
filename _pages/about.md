### Short Bio
I am an Astronomy Ph. D. student at the University of Texas at Austin, working with <a href="https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/people/shapiro/shapiro.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Prof. Paul Shapiro</a>. 
I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. I studied Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering as undergraduate majors at Seoul National University, located in Seoul, South Korea.  Here is my <a href="https://joohyun-lee.github.io/CV_grad.pdf" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">CV</a> in PDF.

### Research
My research interest is mainly on answering theoretical questions about cosmology and galaxy formation using numerical and computational methods. I am open to finding answers to various questions in the field of cosmological structure formation.

### Personal Life
I like soccer (fan of Man Utd), cycling, camping, photos, SF movies & novels, and any other fields of fascinating science.
