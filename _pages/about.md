I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. I studied Physics and Electrical & Computer Enigineering at Seoul National University, located in Seoul, South Korea. I am going to study as an Astronomy Ph. D. candidate at University of Texas at Austin from August, 2021. Here is my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e1t1gl0c0p3tmec/CV.pdf?dl=0" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">CV</a> in PDF.

My research interest is mainly on cosmology and galaxy formation using numerical and computational method. I am open to find out answers about various questions in the field of cosmological structure formation.
