I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. I studied Physics and Electrical & Computer Enigineering at Seoul National University, located in Seoul, South Korea. I am an Astronomy Ph. D. student at University of Texas at Austin from August, 2021. Here is my <a href="https://joohyun-lee.github.io/CV.pdf" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">CV</a> in PDF.

My research interest is mainly on answering theoretical questions about cosmology and galaxy formation using numerical and computational methods. I am open to find out answers about various questions in the field of cosmological structure formation.

Here is the list of my publications in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FLee%2C%20J%2FLee%2C%20Joohyun%22&filter_database_fq_database=AND&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FLee%2C%20J%2FLee%2C%20Joohyun%22&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&p_=0&q=author%3A%22Joohyun%20Lee%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">[ADS]</a>.
