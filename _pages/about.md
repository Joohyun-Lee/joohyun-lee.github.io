I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. I studied Physics and Electrical & Computer Enigineering at Seoul National University, located in Seoul, South Korea. I am an Astronomy Ph. D. student at University of Texas at Austin from August, 2021. Here is my <a href="https://joohyun-lee.github.io/CV.pdf" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">CV</a> in PDF.

My research interest is mainly on answering theoretical questions about cosmology and galaxy formation using numerical and computational methods. I am open to find out answers about various questions in the field of cosmological structure formation.
