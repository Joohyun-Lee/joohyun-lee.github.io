### Multiple Beads-on-a-string Dark Matter Deficient Galaxy Formation in a Mini-bullet Satellite-satellite Galaxy Collision
<br/>

This project is funded by the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId=%7b87947100-56AE-C4DC-C511-0349862D658A%7d&path=open" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">(NASA FINESST)</a> program.

In this study, we present a suite of galaxy collision simulations utilizing the gravitohydrodynamics code Enzo, with initial conditions tailored to match the observed physical properties, kinematics, and alignment of the UDGs in the NGC1052 group. 
Our simulations, supplemented with orbit integration of the galaxies, demonstrate that appropriate initial orbital and structural parameters of the colliding satellite progenitor galaxies can lead to the formation of a series of multiple DMDGs, including two massive DMDGs with $$M_{\star} > 10^{8} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$$ that replicate the observed motions of DF2 and DF4. 
We further report on a few findings that could be examined in future observation programs. 
One of the two satellite progenitors is located at the end of the trail of the DMDGs, which suggests a possible current location. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that the stellar ages and metallicities of the produced DMDGs are nearly identical, and we offer a hint that the tidal field of the host, NGC1052, may contribute to making DMDGs diffuse.
