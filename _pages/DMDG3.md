A recent study by van Dokkum et al. (2022a) examined the distinctively aligned ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the NGC1052 group, including two dark matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs), NGC1052-DF2 (DF2) and NGC1052-DF4 (DF4), suggesting that they might share a common formation site and time, $$\sim 8.9 \pm 1.5$$ Gyr ago. This result supports the Mini-bullet scenario in which multiple DMDGs are produced through a single high-velocity satellite-satellite galaxy collision. In this study, we present a suite of galaxy collision simulations with initial conditions of the colliding satellite progenitor galaxies tailored to match the observed properties of the UDGs in the NGC1052 group, Supplemented with orbit integration of the galaxies, we demonstrate the formation of a series of multiple DMDGs, including two massive DMDGs that replicate the observed motions of DF2 and DF4. We find that while the positions ($$x$$) and velocities ($$v$$) of the aligned DMDGs approximately conform to a linear relationship, $$v = Ax + v_{0}$$, individual DMDGs can significantly deviate from that simple relation. We forecast that one of the collision progenitor galaxies is located at the end of the trail of DMDGs and might be able to be confirmed to be distinct from other UDGs. Additionally, the stellar ages and metallicities of the produced DMDGs are nearly identical. We further offer a hint that the tidal field of the host, NGC1052, may contribute to making DMDGs diffuse. Our results suggest that future deep observations, coupled with realistic simulations, will enable us to validate the Mini-bullet scenario.
