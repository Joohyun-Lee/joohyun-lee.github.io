## Brief TACC system user guide

I made a brief introduction + user guide to the TACC computers, mainly focusing on Stampede3. 
It is here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLPtyZK3-dxmGV8FDPCEkML459A1c449rHoiEcx39kg/edit?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">TACC User Guide</a>.
Please feel free to reach out to me or comment on the Google doc for any comments/suggestions.
