### Dark Matter Deficient Galaxies And Their Member Star Clusters Form Simultaneously
<br/>
It has been a mystery how the diffuse dwarf galaxies that are deficient in dark matter — such as NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4 — have formed. Along with their luminous member globular clusters (GCs), the so-called dark matter deficient galaxies (DMDGs) have challenged observers and theorists alike. Here we report a suite of galaxy collision simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Enzo</span> with 1.25 pc resolution, which demonstrates that high-velocity galaxy collisions induce the formation of DMDGs and their star clusters (SCs) simultaneously. With numerical resolution significantly better than our previous study (80 pc in [Shin et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...25S/abstract)), we resolve the dynamical structure of the produced DMDGs and the detailed formation history of their SCs which are possible progenitors of the DMDG's member GCs. 
In particular, we show that a galaxy collision with a high relative velocity of ~ 300 km/s, invoking severe shock compression, spawns multiple massive SCs (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gtrsim 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}">) within 150 Myr after the collision. At the end of our ~ 800 Myr fiducial run, the resulting DMDG of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_{\star} \simeq 3.5 \times 10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}"> hosts 10 luminous (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=M_{V} \lesssim -8.5\,{\rm {mag}}">), gravitational bound SCs with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion 11.2 km/s. Our study suggests that DMDGs and their luminous member SCs could form simultaneously in high-velocity galaxy collisions while being in line with the key observed properties of NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4.
