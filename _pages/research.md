## Formation of Dark Matter Deficient Galaxies during High-velocity Galaxy Collisions

The recent discovery of diffuse dwarf galaxies that are deficient in dark matter appears to challenge the current
paradigm of structure formation in our Universe. We describe the numerical experiments to determine if the
so-called dark matter deficient galaxies (DMDGs) could be produced when two gas-rich, dwarf-sized galaxies
collide with a high relative velocity of ~ 300 km/s. Using idealized high-resolution simulations with both
mesh-based and particle-based gravito-hydrodynamics codes, we find that DMDGs can form as high-velocity
galaxy collisions separate dark matter from the warm disk gas which subsequently is compressed by shock and
tidal interaction to form stars. Then using a large simulated universe ILLUSTRISTNG, we discover a number
of high-velocity galaxy collision events in which DMDGs are expected to form. However, we did not find
evidence that these types of collisions actually produced DMDGs in the ILLUSTRISTNG100-1 run. We argue
that the resolution of the numerical experiment is critical to realize the “collision-induced” DMDG formation
scenario. Our results demonstrate one of many routes in which galaxies could form with unconventional dark
matter fractions.
